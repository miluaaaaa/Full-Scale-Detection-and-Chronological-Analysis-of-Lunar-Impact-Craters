# High-Resolution Lunar Crater Detection and Chronology Estimation through Generative Enhancement and Redundancy Filtering
This repository contains the code for our paper "Full-Scale Detection and Chronological Analysis of Lunar Impact Craters via Enhanced YOLOv8 Framework" submitted to The Visual Computer. We present an improved detection framework for lunar crater analysis using enhanced YOLOv8 architecture.
