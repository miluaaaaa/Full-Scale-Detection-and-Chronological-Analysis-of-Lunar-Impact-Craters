# Full-Scale-Detection-and-Chronological-Analysis-of-Lunar-Impact-Craters
This repository contains the code and data for our paper "Full-Scale Detection and Chronological Analysis of Lunar Impact Craters via Enhanced YOLOv8 Framework" submitted to The Visual Computer. We present an improved detection framework for lunar crater analysis using enhanced YOLOv8 architecture.
